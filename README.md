# rpi-diozero-test
Playing around with the diozero library for Java on the Raspberry Pi. This will eventually lead to stuff like build status
visualization for Jenkins build using an LED strip and similar stuff - for the time being it's just a playground.

Look at https://github.com/mattjlewis/diozero for more information.
